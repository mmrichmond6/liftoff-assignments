## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My project will be a chore log that will allow household members to track the chores that they do with administrators creating and evaluating those said chores.  It will allow household members to log in, administrators to create and edit chore details such as date/time, location, title, description, point value, rated quality of completion, and tally points earned.  Users will be able to see views of the chores and all users (completed/incomplete chores, chore difficulty level-points possible/earned, user points earned-who has done what).

This project was motivated by the need for a household to run more efficiently without placing an unfair burden on any one member while encouraging everyone to grow in their knowledge, abilities and contribution to said household.

### Features
*User login:  Users will be able to log in by using a third-party authentication provider (Google Authentication).  All access to the site will be restricted to logged-in users.  The administrators will have editing rights, while other users may only have user rights.

*Create and edit chores:  Administrators will be able to create new chores in the system by entering in a mixture of required (title, category, frequency/day, difficulty level/points) and optional fields (description, assigned a specific user, etc).  Chores will either be assigned to specific users or placed in the “any user” category.

*View chores:  Users will be able to view a listing of assigned chores and “any user” chores.  By clicking on a chore they will be able to view details and commit to completing the chore and marking it completed (ready for review).

*View users:  All users will be able to view a list of chores completed and total points earned by each user.

*Review chores and evaluate:  Upon completion of the chore administrators will be able to submit an evaluation of the chore’s quality directly resulting in points being added to the user’s account.

*User tracking:  Administrators will be able to add users to the system, and assign users to chores.

*Delete chores: Administrators will be able to delete chores.

*SMS messages:  SMS reminders will be sent to users when an assigned chore needs to be completed within a specific time frame.  SMS messages will be sent when a user’s chore has been evaluated and points have been added to their account.
